# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

JSCL-PAIP is a web application that runs Peter Norvig's "Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming" (PAIP) Common Lisp code in the browser using JSCL (a Lisp-to-JavaScript compiler).

## Build Commands

```bash
# Build the project (requires SBCL and Node.js)
./make.sh

# Start development server (serves dist/ on localhost:3000)
npm start
```

## Architecture

- **paip/** - Common Lisp source files from Norvig's PAIP book (gps.lisp, eliza.lisp, etc.)
- **dist/** - Built output served to browser (generated by make.sh)
- **jscl/** - Cloned JSCL compiler (generated by make.sh, gitignored)
