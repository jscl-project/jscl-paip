# JSCL-PAIP

An interactive web version of the code from Peter Norvig's *Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming* (PAIP), running entirely in the browser via [JSCL](https://github.com/jscl-project/jscl).

## About

This project brings the classic AI programming examples from PAIP to the web, allowing you to explore and experiment with the code without any local setup. JSCL compiles Common Lisp to JavaScript, making it possible to run these programs directly in your browser.
